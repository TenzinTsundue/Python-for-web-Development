# Python-for-web-Development
here I am intended to put web development stuff using Python

Python shines is web development. Python offers many frameworks from which to choose from including <br> <strong>bottle.py, Flask, CherryPy, Pyramid, Django and web2py.</strong> 

```
$ pip install Django==2.2.6
```
```
$ django-admin startproject mysite
```

**DJANGO MVC - MVT Pattern**

The Model-View-Template (MVT) is slightly different from MVC. In fact the main difference between the two patterns is that Django itself takes care of the Controller part (Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View), leaving us with the template. The template is a HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL).
